							<h4>When I miss a deadline, you get paid</h4>
							<p>I'm Matthew Gatland and I used to make <a href="">tiny</a> <a href="">games</a> <a href="">all</a> <a href="">the</a> <a href="">time</a>. But then something went wrong.</p><br>
							<img class="smallImg" src="img/1.png" alt="">
							 I got tired &ndash; or lazy &ndash; or caught up in the other parts of life. I don't know what happened. All I know is this: for the first time in my adult life, I've gone 12 months without releasing a game.</p><br>
							<p>You can help! I don't need your money. I just need some pressure. I need a reason to get the job done, so I can't keep putting it off.</p><br>
							<p>So here's the deal: from now on, every month, I <i>will</i> release a game. But if I don't, I'll pay each of my anti-patrons 5 New Zealand dollars.</p><br>
							<p>If I miss the deadline, I have to pay up.</p><br>
							<p>Hopefully that's enough pressure to force me back into action. If it's not, you'll find out in your monthy payment email!</p><br>
							<!--<h4>Technical Details</h4>
							<p>Sending actual money is actually quite difficult. My current plan is to pay you in Steam credit. When you sign up I'll collect your Steam username and add you as a friend. Steam will, <i>in theory</i>, let me send out as many Steam gift cards as I like, as long as they are to people I was already friends with.</p><br>
							<p>If this doesn't work - for example if Steam bans me for suspicious payment behaviour - we'll figure out something else.</p><br>
							<p>I reserve the right to remove or refuse to add anti-patrons for any reason, but especially for being a bad person.</p>-->
