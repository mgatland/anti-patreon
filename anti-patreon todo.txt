to do:

[x] facebook and twitter share buttons
[x] progress bar
[x] page between the goals

[ ] mobile friendly mode

[ ] polish the main content

[ ] the sign-up page and flow

[ ] dynamic patreon count? including goal progress?

minor:
twitter button icon should be borderless, it shows up when the button is hovered and changes color

do another pass on what the social (fb and twitter) links actually do - check the og: tags so what is shared makes sense.
