to do:

[x] mobile friendly layouts
[x] fix 'become an anti-patron' button on narrow layouts
[x] revise breakpoints and make social buttons handle small sizes without line breaking
[x] polish the main content, add pictures
[x] the sign-up page

[x] add terms and conditions
[ ] when you click 'submit' on sign up page, what do you see?
[ ] dynamic patreon count? including goal progress?
[ ] og: etc tags for social.
[ ] consider recaptcha

titles:
moochreon
taketrion


[x] facebook and twitter share buttons
[x] progress bar
[x] page between the goals


minor:
[x] twitter button icon should be borderless, it shows up when the button is hovered and changes color
do another pass on what the social (fb and twitter) links actually do - check the og: tags so what is shared makes sense.
