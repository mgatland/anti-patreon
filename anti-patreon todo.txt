to do:

[...] mobile friendly layouts
[ ] fix 'become an anti-patron' button on narrow layouts
[ ] polish the main content, add pictures
[ ] the sign-up page and flow
[ ] dynamic patreon count? including goal progress?
[ ] og: etc tags for social.
[ ] revise breakpoints and make social buttons handle small sizes without line breaking

[x] facebook and twitter share buttons
[x] progress bar
[x] page between the goals


minor:
twitter button icon should be borderless, it shows up when the button is hovered and changes color
do another pass on what the social (fb and twitter) links actually do - check the og: tags so what is shared makes sense.
